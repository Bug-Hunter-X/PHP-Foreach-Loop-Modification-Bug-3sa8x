This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to modifying arrays within a foreach loop.  The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` offers a corrected version. The issue arises from how PHP's foreach loop handles array modifications during iteration. Unsetting elements can cause unexpected skips in the iteration process. The solution shows alternative approaches that avoid this behavior.
